      <description>Welcome to my personal website. It has been written while learning to use Hugo, a static site generator. This website is using Hugo-Geo Theme to render the web page. You will find here various information, and even maybe some blog articles like this one !
If you want to make your own website and enjoy hacking, you must definitely check out the Getting Started Tutorial of Hugo and find out if it suits to your needs.</description>

      <description>I enjoy writing code and wanted to become a doctor or a pharmacist during my childhood to help people. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to do software development in healthcare. Iâ€™m currently employed as a Software Engineer at BIONEXT SA, where I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of BiovizJS, a 3D molecular visualization Web application. My work includes developing the application, finding new ideas to improve users experience and train partners to embbed it into their website.</description>

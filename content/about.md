I enjoy writing code and wanted to become a doctor or a pharmacist during my childhood to help people. That's why I decided to do software development in healthcare. I’m currently employed as a Software Engineer at _BIONEXT SA_, where I'm in charge of _BiovizJS_, a 3D molecular visualization Web application. My work includes developing the application, finding new ideas to improve users experience and train partners to embbed it into their website.

In my spare time I enjoy producing music, marathon viewing (thank you _Netflix_ !) and hiking. I made a solo hike trip in 2014 during 5 days to traverse the whole of an alpine massif called La Lauzière.

When I'm at home, I usually like to create new music tracks. It allows me to develop my creativity and also improve my signal processing knowledge acquired during my engineering school. Indeed, synthesizer programming is a nice crossover between programmation and physics. Do not hesitate to check my _Soundcloud_ !

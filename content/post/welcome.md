Welcome to my personal website. It has been written while learning to use [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a static site generator. This website is using [Hugo-Geo Theme](https://github.com/alexurquhart/hugo-geo) to render the web page. You will find here various information, and even maybe some blog articles like this one !

If you want to make your own website and enjoy hacking, you must definitely check out the [Getting Started Tutorial](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/) of Hugo and find out if it suits to your needs.

Cheers !
